LocationsApp Notes
===========================

Features to add:

- Force touch on row
	* should show preview of location
	* allow for options:
		~ edit name
		~ share location

- When segueing to map from row press:
	* show location name + description
		(or address of no name given to location)

	
- Change how locations are stored
	* from two arrays to one hashmap or dictionary?
	* want to store 3 strings: Name, Description, Address (String, String, Stringl)
	* want to store latitude + longitude doubles as tuple (Double,Double)

	~ Probably ideal to use a Tuple of (String, Coordinate)
		- where Coordinate is Tuple of (Double, Double) or CLLocationPoint?

- Create new Class for handling + parsing location on map

- Create Setting view
	* change themes
	* information about app
