# LocationsApp
iOS app that stores locations

Uses TableView that displays all saved locations with button that segue to Map View

Map View shows user location and has button to save User's current location
* Also has button to center view on user's location.
* Long Press will save location pressed and place pin on that location

if you want to read my code the only ones of interest are:
* LocationTableView.swift (Table of locations)
* ViewController.swift (Implentation of Map View)
